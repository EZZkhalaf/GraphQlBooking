# Event Booking GraphQL API
This project is a simple Event Booking App backend built with GraphQL and MongoDB, along with a minimal React frontend to test and understand GraphQL operations like queries and mutations.

##  Purpose

I created this project to:
- Learn how to build a backend API using **GraphQL**
- Understand authentication and protected routes with **JWT**
- Practice how GraphQL integrates with a frontend (React)

**Note:** The frontend is very basic and was only implemented to test and visualize GraphQL requests/responses. The focus of this project is the backend logic and GraphQL implementation.
